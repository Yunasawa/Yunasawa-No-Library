## Description
```
If you are making an inventory system for your game and you use Button to show if the item is selected or invoke methods that
be called when you clicked on the Button, then you have a very big problem, the item slot (Button) will be deselected when you
click on a random place. Or when you make a button to delete an item, you want that when you press the button by accident, and
you want to hover it out of the button then release it to cancel the deleting action, but the Button that Unity gives you is so
suck? Here is the solution:

A better version of Unity's Button:
- Have more individual modes for different purposes. Such as
    + Standard Button: A normal button works the same as Unity's but have more event invoked.
    + Ignore Deselect: Solution for unwantedly deselect the button with just clicking on UI objects with specific layer.
    + Hover To Select: Don't need to click on the button, just hover it to make the button selected.
    + Only Click Button: Button only used for clicking, not be selected.
- Familiar usage due to some properties are the same with Unity's button.
